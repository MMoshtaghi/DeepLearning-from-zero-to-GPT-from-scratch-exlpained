# DeepLearning-from-zero-to-GPT-from-scratch-exlpained
A step-by-step guide for Deep Learning from basics to Decoder-Transformer models (GPT) from scratch | PyTorch

The theoretical concepts and codes are explained next to each other in a Jupyter Notebook file. You will get an intuitive understanding of why we need each operation in the computational graph and how they work through visualization and basically scrutinizing the inputs and outputs.

Thanks to Andrej Karpathy and his [NN Zero to Hero tutorial](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html) which I used and extended for this one.

Hope you enjoy and learn better :)
